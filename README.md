# Files Mover

Move all files of a certain format from a folder, and if needed from its subfolders, to another one.

## How To:
- Launch **Run FilesMover.bat**.
- Copy and paste the source directory.
- Choose if you wanna move files only from the selected folder or also from its subfolders.
- Copy and paste the destination directory.
- Type the extention of the files you wanna move (for example "jpg", "pdf" or "dwg").
- Repeat the operation or exit the program selecting the appropriate option.

For ease of use you can create a link of the .bat file and keep it in some handy place on your hard drive instead of always look for the files' folder you can safely archive somewhere else instead.
